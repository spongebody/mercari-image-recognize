## How It Works

Provide an array of model IDs in priority order. If the first model returns an error, OpenRouter will automatically try the next model in the list.

<CodeGroup>

```python title="Python"
import requests
import json

response = requests.post(
  url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions",
  headers={
    "Authorization": "Bearer <OPENROUTER_API_KEY>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  data=json.dumps({
    "models": ["anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", "gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b"],
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
      }
    ]
  })
)

data = response.json()
print(data['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
```

</CodeGroup>

## Fallback Behavior

If the model you selected returns an error, OpenRouter will try to use the fallback model instead. If the fallback model is down or returns an error, OpenRouter will return that error.

By default, any error can trigger the use of a fallback model, including:
- Context length validation errors
- Moderation flags for filtered models
- Rate-limiting
- Downtime

## Pricing

Requests are priced using the model that was ultimately used, which will be returned in the `model` attribute of the response body.

## Using with OpenAI SDK

To use the `models` array with the OpenAI SDK, include it in the `extra_body` parameter. In the example below, gpt-4o will be tried first, and the `models` array will be tried in order as fallbacks.

<Template data={{
  API_KEY_REF,
}}>
<CodeGroup>


```python
from openai import OpenAI

openai_client = OpenAI(
  base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1",
  api_key={{API_KEY_REF}},
)

completion = openai_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="openai/gpt-4o",
    extra_body={
        "models": ["anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet", "gryphe/mythomax-l2-13b"],
    },
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the meaning of life?"
        }
    ]
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```
